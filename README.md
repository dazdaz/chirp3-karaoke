## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- uv package manager ([install here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- Google Cloud account with Speech-to-Text API enabled
- Google Cloud credentials configured

### Setup with uv

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dazdaz/chirp3-karaoke-king.git
cd chirp3-karaoke-king
```

2. Set up Google Cloud credentials:
```bash
# Set your Google Cloud project ID
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth application-default login
```

3. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

4. Initialize the song database:
```bash
# Download songs from Bandcamp
uv run python setup_music.py <bandcamp_album_url> <name of artist or band>
# Or see README_MUSIC_SETUP.md for detailed music setup instructions
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Legacy pip Installation (Optional)

If you prefer to use pip instead of uv:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t karaoke-king .
docker run -p 8080:8080 karaoke-king
```

- **Long**: 40 seconds
- **Extended**: 50 seconds
- **Minute**: 60 seconds
- **Full Song**: Complete track

## Scoring System

The application uses an advanced AI-powered scoring engine that:
- Normalizes text and handles contractions ("gonna" → "going to")
- Uses Jaro-Winkler similarity for fuzzy matching
- Awards full points for exact matches (green)
- Gives partial credit for close matches (yellow)
- Deducts points for wrong words (red)
- Identifies missing lyrics (gray)
- Applies a "vibe boost" for similar word counts
